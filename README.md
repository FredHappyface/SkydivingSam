## Coursework 1
- 10 Marks available for game design:

Controls ‚úÖ
  - 3 marks for event handling (i.e., environment reacts to a player‚Äôs interaction in an expected way - like a bullet comes out of a gun or a character falls off a ledge)
Collision detection ‚úÖ
  - 4 marks for environment automation (i.e., the game starts and plays even if the player doesn‚Äôt do anything - like when aliens appear and attack or a timer counts down)
Scrolling level, elements spawned randomly ‚úÖ
- 5 Marks for developer tools:
  - 5 Marks for anything that may help the developer test the game (i.e., cheat keys to jump through a level, invulnerability on or off)
